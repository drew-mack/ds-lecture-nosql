NoSQL Databases
===============

Before databases, computers would store data in formats such as files on disk,
or even paper with holes punched in it very early on. The emergence of the
database was a revolution in the field of data storage. At the time of their inception,
Structured Query Language, or SQL style databases quickly dominated the database space.
Data within SQL databases can only be stored once a relationship or relationships between
the data have been defined. For that reason, SQL databases are referred to as relational
databases. But just as storage media before them, the concept could be iterated upon
to better suit the needs of some tasks. To that end, many projects in the world of
software development have taken to employing NoSQL databases.

Exactly how they sound, NoSQL databases do not require the definition or a relationship
in order to start storing data. This freedom grants many of strengths present in NoSQL
databases that their SQL sisters lack. The two critical advantages for NoSQL are
syntax and scalability. Although quality SQL syntax resources are plentiful[^1], the
necessary notation for describing and working within the pre-defined schema of a
relational database can feel restrictive. As far as scalability, SQL databases scale
vertically, whereas NoSQL databases scale horizontally. What that essentially means is
SQL databases need a more powerful server in order to serve more clients, but a NoSQL
database only needs more servers at all. This flexibility allows NoSQL databases to
potentially expand much more rapidly than SQL servers, thus accomodating datasets that
increase in size more rapidly[^2].
