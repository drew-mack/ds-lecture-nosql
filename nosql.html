<h1 id="nosql-databases">NoSQL Databases</h1>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Before databases, computers would store data in formats such as files on disk, or even paper with holes punched in it very early on. The emergence of the database was a revolution in the field of data storage. At the time of their inception, Structured Query Language, or SQL style databases quickly dominated the database space. Data within SQL databases can only be stored once a relationship or relationships between the data have been defined. For that reason, SQL databases are referred to as <em>relational</em> databases. But just as storage media before them, the concept could be iterated upon to better suit the needs of some tasks. To that end, many projects in the world of software development have taken to employing NoSQL databases.</p>
<p>Exactly how they sound, NoSQL databases do not require the definition or a relational structure in order to start storing data. At the same time, NoSQL databases also preserve the guarantees critical to the basic function of a database such as operation atomicity. This freedom grants many of strengths present in NoSQL databases that their SQL sisters lack. The two critical advantages for NoSQL are syntax and scalability. Although quality SQL syntax resources are plentiful<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the necessary notation for describing and working within the pre-defined schema of a relational database can feel restrictive. As far as scalability, SQL databases scale vertically, whereas NoSQL databases scale horizontally. What that essentially means is SQL databases need a more powerful server in order to serve more clients, but a NoSQL database only needs more servers at all. This flexibility allows NoSQL databases to potentially expand much more rapidly than SQL servers, thus accomodating datasets that increase in size more rapidly<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Many NoSQL database frameworks have been developed by various software manufacturers, and each comes with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular are MongoDB, Redis, HBase, DynamoDB, Neo4j, InfoGrid, and the list goes on. Aside from implementation, the necessity of different frameworks comes from the desire for different data storage structures. Whereas SQL databases typically only come in one storage structure, tables, NoSQL databases have variety. Some of these structures are document storage as in MongoDB<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, coulumn storage as in HBase<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, graph storage as in InfoGrid, and key value storage as in Redis<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Each has its ideal use case, and each could stand as a section of its own. For the purpose of introduction, we have elected to use Redis as its base functionality is relatively simple, but its full potential is vast.</p>

<p>Redis is a NoSQL database focused on efficiency. Based on this focus, it operates mainly in memory rather than on disk in order to reduce write and read times. On disk data representations are supported by means of dumping, or by maintaining a log of actions that can be used to replicate a failed instance. Its key value data storage supports values stored as strings, lists, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indicies<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. In addition to serving as a cache in this way, redis provides a host of other features such as providing a publisher/subscriber messenger service, server-based Lua script execution, pipelines that support sending many commands at the same time to save on network round trip time, streams that act like maps with built in history, and built in time to live support for an instance's keys.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>As officially recommended by Redis Labs, the following is the standard installation method for redis on any Debian based Linux distrobution, including Ubuntu, with Apt. Many other dependency resolvers such as YUM or ZYpp standard in other Linux distrobutions will also cleanly install Redis.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install redis-server</code></pre>
<p>After installing, to run an instance of Redis one would send the following command.</p>
<pre><code>sudo service redis-server start</code></pre>
<p>Now that one has an instance of the server up and running on the default host and port, <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and <code>6379</code> respectively, one can connect to it. The command for such is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>redis-cli</code></pre>
<p>After sending that command, bash will switch from prompting the user with <code>$PS1</code> on new lines, to prompting with <code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt;</code> on new lines in this case. It is possible to connect to a different instance of Redis server in this way, or to initiate an instance of the Redis server in a non-default location but for demonstration purposes, we will keep it simple.</p>
<p>At this point, since the server instance is brand new, nothing is in it. One can verify this with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; KEYS *
(empty list or set)</code></pre>
<p>Redis functions that support finding keys such as <code>KEYS</code> and <code>SCAN</code> use glob-style pattern matching. Supported pattern syntax is as follows<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>: * h?llo matches hello, hallo and hxllo * h<em>llo matches hllo and heeeello </em> h[ae]llo matches hello and hallo, but not hillo * h[^e]llo matches hallo, hbllo, ... but not hello * h[a-b]llo matches hallo and hbllo * \]\^\*\? matches ]^*?</p>
<p>So in the previous example, <code>KEYS *</code> returns every possible key as the <code>*</code> pattern means any combination of characters.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>To alleviate the lack of members in the Redis server, one could add a list like so.</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; RPUSH good_list &quot;good value&quot;
(integer) 1</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note here that we haven't defined <code>good_list</code> at any point before appending the string <code>&quot;good value&quot;</code> to it. This is because of the practicality built-in to Redis' semantic design. Before a list exists, the only way to add to it is to <code>RPUSH</code> a value or values into it. And in case one wants to be sure that the list they are trying to append to already exists before they do so, <code>RPUSHX</code> satisfies that use case. The other stipulation that <code>RPUSHX</code> imposes is that only one value can be added to a list with it, whereas <code>RPUSH</code> allows for appending of any number of items to a list in one command. Redis also supports the same operations from the beginning of the list, rather than the end, with <code>LPUSH</code> and <code>LPUSHX</code>.</p>
<p>A bit of important information that redis gives the user with <code>RPUSH</code> is the integer in the return statement, <code>(integer) 1</code>. The parenthesized <code>integer</code> in the return is merely a quality of life feature standard in redis returns. Here its inclusion serves to explicity indicate that the value <code>1</code> is an integer and not a string. The number 1 itself represents the length of the list after <code>RPUSH</code>ing <code>&quot;good_value&quot;</code>. We will see the same kind of inclusion with <code>LRANGE</code> right now, along with <code>RPUSH</code> appending multiple values to <code>good_list</code>.</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; RPUSH good_list &quot;another good one&quot; 45
(integer) 3
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; LRANGE good_list 0 -1
1) &quot;good value&quot;
2) &quot;another good one&quot;
3) &quot;45&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>LRANGE</code> is used to retrieve a subset of values from <code>good_list</code> beginning at index <code>0</code> and ending at index <code>-1</code>. Redis supports indexing based on relative position from the front with positive numbers and 0, as well as from relative position to the back with negative numbers. Given the indicies, the subset this particular <code>LRANGE</code> retrieved is the entire list, as is the case with all <code>0 -1</code> retrievals. On the note of indicies, Redis accomodates those that might be considered invalid. For instance, a starting index bigger than the ending index will simply return an empty list of results, and an ending index larger than the actual final index in the list will default to the final index of the list.</p>
<p>Speaking of indicies, Redis also supports index based item retrieval like so.</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; LINDEX good_list 2
&quot;45&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We hope this short demonstration serves as an easy introduction to Redis lists, but the support that Redis offers for lists doesn't stop there by a long shot. In addition to what is shown here, they support: * Popping from the left or right, blocking or non-blocking * Retrieving the length of a list * Inserting at a given index * Setting a given index's value * Removing at a given index * Trimming to a desired size * Cycling the member on the back of a list to the front</p>
<h3 id="more-storage-options7">More Storage Options<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, Redis actually supports quite a few data-structure like models for storing data. Each of these other storage formats suit the needs of some tasks better than others. Some of the broader-application models will be expanded upon briefly in this section.</p>
<h4 id="strings">Strings</h4>
<p>Strings are the most basic data types supported by Redis. Despite their simplicity, they have some interesting capabilities. They are obatained and set with <code>GET</code> and <code>SET</code>, but they can also be obtained and set multiple-at-a-time style with <code>MGET</code> and <code>MSET</code>. The <code>GETSET</code> command will return the current value and replace it with the value provided. Redis also supports implied integer parsing and incrementation with <code>INCR</code>, and <code>EXPIRE</code> and <code>PERSIST</code> allow users to control whether a key will eventually delete itself with the previously mentioned time to live feature. All key value types support this feature with their own variations of these commands.</p>
<h4 id="hashes">Hashes</h4>
<p>Redis hashes function like, well, hash maps. When defined as follows, they support all of the functionalities that one might expect of a hash map such as accessing and setting by field.</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; HMSET hash_key field1 value1 field2 value2
OK
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; HGET hash_key field1
&quot;value1&quot;
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; HGETALL hash_key
1) &quot;field1&quot;
2) &quot;value1&quot;
3) &quot;field2&quot;
4) &quot;value2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>These hashes are particularly useful for generally representing objects from any object oriented programming language.</p>
<h4 id="sets">Sets</h4>
<p>Redis sets perform in much the same way as mathmatically defined sets with members being unordered and unique. In addition to accomodating sets, Redis natively supports basic set-oriented operations such as intersections and unions. Some of their practicality comes from being able to internally track membership of other keys in certain groups without needing to pull data into a different context to perform useful membership-focused analyses.</p>
<h4 id="sorted-sets">Sorted Sets</h4>
<p>In addition to traditionally implemented sets, Redis supports a bit of a fusion of hashes and sets referred to as sorted sets. This fusion derives from the unique member guarantee coupled with a &quot;score&quot; attatched to each member which Redis uses to sort them. Scores are determined by the user at the time of entry, editable at any time, and duplicate scores are tolerated. To sort identically scored members, Redis evaluates lexigraphical score which is necessarily unique since members are necessarily unique. Though less efficient in some functionality, sorted sets excel at tasks where fast score-based retrieval is helpful such as retrieving frequency of contact with friends on a social media website.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>By analyzing some of the specifics of Redis, we hope it becomes clear why NoSQL databases are beginning to dominate the data storage arena. At the core of its design, Redis was and is built for lightning fast operation. One would be right to observe that this emphasis on performance comes from the necessity to fill that niche in the software development world. For many purposes, data storage need not be hyper-performing, but the applications where saving however many microseconds one can are increasing. In the world of high frequency trading, as well as website advertisement bidding, that short time can make the difference between making a good or bad decision.</p>
<p>Extrapolating that point, the other NoSQL database technologies seek to and succeed at satisfying similar niches. Of course, this doesn't mean that SQL is necessarily obsolescing, but the projects that could benefit from faster, more scalable, or more loosely designed data storage utilities are driving these innovations. In an obvious way, NoSQL utilities can be viewed as a kind of specialization of databases. If a reliable, more custom-fit solution to, let's say, Google needing to store and access data about its service users could be well implemented, then of course they would demand innovation of that technology. Many companies are applying that same thought process to their own data architechture via NoSQL databases.</p>
